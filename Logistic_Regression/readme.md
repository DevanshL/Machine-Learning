# Logistic Regression Model

This project contains a simple implementation of a Logistic Regression model in Python using scikit-learn for classification tasks.

## Description
Logistic Regression is a widely used machine learning algorithm for binary classification. This model is trained to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. It's particularly useful for problems where the output is binary, such as spam detection or medical diagnosis.

## Files

- `Logistic_Regression.ipynb`: Python script containing the implementation of the SimpleLinearRegression class.
