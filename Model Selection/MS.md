# Model Selection 

## Introduction

Model selection is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves choosing the best set of hyperparameters for your model. Two commonly used techniques for model selection are k-fold cross-validation and Grid Search CV.

# K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-fold cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models. It involves splitting the dataset into k subsets (folds) and training the model k times, each time using a different fold as the test set and the remaining data as the training set. The average performance across all k iterations is then used as the final performance metric.

# Grid Search CV

Grid Search CV is a method for hyperparameter tuning that exhaustively searches through a specified hyperparameter grid. It evaluates the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters using cross-validation. This helps identify the optimal set of hyperparameters that result in the best model performance.

## Usage

To use k-fold cross-validation and Grid Search CV for model selection, follow these general steps:

1. **Split your dataset:** Divide your dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Define the model:** Choose the machine learning model you want to train.
3. **Set up the hyperparameter grid:** Define the hyperparameter grid for Grid Search CV.
4. **Grid Search CV:** Use Grid Search CV to search through the hyperparameter grid and find the best combination.
5. **Evaluate the model:** Use k-fold cross-validation to obtain a robust performance estimate.
