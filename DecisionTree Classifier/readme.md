# Decision Tree Classifiers

This repository contains implementations of Decision Tree classifiers in Python for classification tasks.

## Description

This project demonstrates the usage of Decision Tree classifiers for classification tasks. Decision Tree is a tree-like model that makes decisions based on the features of the input data.

## Files

- `DTC.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the Decision Tree class.
- `Social_Network_Ads.csv`: Sample CSV file containing your dataset (replace with your actual dataset).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy

Install the necessary libraries using the following command:

## bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy

## Usage

`Clone the repository`:

- git clone https://github.com/DevanshL/Machine-Learning.git
- cd Machine-Learning/main/DecisionTree Classifier
