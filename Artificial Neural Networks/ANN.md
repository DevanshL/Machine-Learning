# Deep Learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow for a classification task. The project involves encoding categorical data, splitting the dataset into training and test sets, feature scaling, building the ANN, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Project Structure


## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For running and modifying the provided notebooks
- **TensorFlow**: Install using `pip install tensorflow`

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebooks:**

    Open and run Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for step-by-step execution.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

    - Encoding Categorical Data
    - Splitting into Training and Test Sets
    - Feature Scaling

2. **Building the ANN:**

    - Initializing the ANN
    - Adding Input Layer and First Hidden Layer
    - Adding Second Hidden Layer
    - Adding Output Layer

3. **Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model:**

    - Compiling the ANN
    - Training ANN on Training Set
    - Predicting Test Results
    - Confusion Matrix
