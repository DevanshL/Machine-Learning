# Thompson Sampling in Reinforcement Learning

A Python implementation of the Thompson Sampling algorithm in reinforcement learning.

## Overview

This repository provides a simple implementation of the Thompson Sampling algorithm for solving multi-armed bandit problems in the context of reinforcement learning. Thompson Sampling is a Bayesian approach to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, and this implementation is designed for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Thompson Sampling Algorithm**: Implementing the Thompson Sampling algorithm.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the cumulative reward over time.
- **Customization**: Easily adaptable for different problem scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/thompson-sampling-reinforcement-learning.git
```
