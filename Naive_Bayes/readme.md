# Naive Bayes Classifier

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier in Python for classification tasks.

## Description

This project demonstrates the usage of a Naive Bayes classifier for classification tasks. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem and is widely used for text classification and spam filtering.

## Files

- `NB.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the Naive Bayes class.
- `NB_scratch.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the Naive Bayes class from scratch.
- `Social_Network_Ads.csv`: Sample CSV file containing your dataset (replace with your actual dataset).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy

Install the necessary libraries using the following command:

## bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy

## Usage

`Clone the repository`:

- git clone https://github.com/DevanshL/Machine-Learning.git
- cd Machine-Learning/main/Naive_Bayes
