# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for supervised dimensionality reduction.

## Introduction

In this project, we implement LDA, a technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving the information that discriminates between classes.

## Features

- LDA implementation with customizable number of components
- Custom implementation with fit, transform, and fit_transform methods
- Example of usage with a dataset

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lda-dimensionality-reduction.git
cd lda-dimensionality-reduction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```Acknowledgements
git clone https://github.com/Devansh/Machine-Learning.git
cd LDA
```
